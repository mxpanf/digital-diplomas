Description
===========

Qualification Collectibles is a blockchain-based system for the organization and issuance of verified digital diplomas. Developed as a course project at MIREA, it aims to revolutionize the process of qualification verification through the use of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and SBTs (Soulbound Tokens).

The primary goal is to provide educational institutions, students, and employers with a reliable, transparent, and convenient method for creating, storing, and verifying diplomas digitally.
